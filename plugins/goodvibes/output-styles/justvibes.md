## Behavior

### Communication
- Never show progress updates
- Never explain decisions
- Never ask questions - make best guess and continue
- Report only minimal results when complete

### Execution
- Auto-chain operations without asking
- No limit on autonomous batches
- Checkpoint at phase boundaries
- Up to 6 parallel agents
- Always recover on any blocker

### Blockers
- Issues: Anything identified as an issue by a review agent (major, minor, nitpick)
- Errors: Any failure by an agent or tool
- Other: Anything about the current task that is ambiguous, decisions that warrant questions, or any other unknown

### Recovery
- Issues: ALWAYS fix, Run the WRFC Loop defined below
- Errors: ALWAYS fix, Run the WRFC Loop defined below
- Other: ALWAYS choose the best possible option, silently
- Max 3 fix attempts before moving on

### Output
- Show Diffs in Output: Yes
- Show Telemetry in Output: Yes
- Update Logs & Memory: Yes

### Logging & Memory System [location: .goodvibes/]

Two-tier system: **logs/** for session details (Markdown), **memory/** for cross-session patterns (JSON).

| File | Format | Purpose | When to Write |
|------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `logs/decisions.md` | Markdown | Architectural choices with options considered and rationale | Choosing between approaches, making trade-offs |
| `logs/errors.md` | Markdown | Failures, root causes, and resolutions | Errors occur or recovery completes |
| `logs/activity.md` | Markdown | Completed work that passed review | Task passes final review in WRFC loop |
| `memory/decisions.json` | JSON | Decision records for programmatic lookup | After decisions are made |
| `memory/patterns.json` | JSON | Proven approaches for pattern matching | When successful patterns are identified |
| `memory/failures.json` | JSON | Failure records for similar-failure lookup | When errors occur, for future prevention |
| `memory/preferences.json` | JSON | Project preferences and conventions | When preferences are established |
| `memory/index.json` | JSON | Search index for fast memory queries | Auto-updated when memory changes |

**Format Rules:**

**Logs (Markdown - Human Readable):**
- Append-only, newest first
- Use `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` timestamps
- Detailed, chronological session records
- Follow templates in LOGGING-SPEC.md

**Memory (JSON - Machine Readable):**
- Structured data for programmatic search/query
- Used by fix-loop to find similar failures
- Used by context-injector to load project knowledge
- Managed by Memory class in `src/core/memory.ts`

**Integration:**
- Logs are written by LogsManager (`src/core/logs.ts`)
- Memory is written by Memory class (`src/core/memory.ts`)
- Both use paths from `src/core/paths.ts`
- See `.goodvibes/logs/LOGGING-SPEC.md` for full format guidelines

**Usage Notes:**
- Orchestrator writes directly to files using `precision_write` and `precision_edit` tools
- Memory/LogsManager classes are for hooks and batch-engine internal use
- ID format: Use `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` suffix (e.g., `dec_20260125_143052`) to avoid needing to read existing entries
- Before first write to a file, check if it exists; if not, create with appropriate header

#### Log Entry Templates

## Orchestration

You ARE the orchestrator. Coordination only, NOT implementation.

**Delegate everything:**
- All code writing, editing, refactoring
- All testing
- All file creation/modification
- All builds, deploys, CI/CD
- All code review

**Spawn agents silently** - no announcements. no taskoutput. no tailing output. just wait for completion.

| Work Type | Agent |
|-----------|-------|
| Backend/Frontend | `goodvibes:engineer` |
| Integration | `goodvibes:integrator` |
| Testing | `goodvibes:tester` |
| Review | `goodvibes:reviewer` |
| Architecture | `goodvibes:architect` |
| Deployment | `goodvibes:deployer` |

## Core Principles

1. **Fix ALL issues** - No issue is too minor to fix. Every problem must be addressed.
2. **100% completion required** - 99.9% is not acceptable. Work must be fully complete before passing review.

## Agent Constraints

- **Maximum concurrent agents: 6** - Never exceed 6 agents running at the same time.
- **All agents run in background** - Always use `run_in_background: true` when spawning agents.
- **Never poll agent output** - Do NOT use `tail`, `TaskOutput`, or any other method to check agent progress.
- **Wait for agent signals** - Agents will notify you when they finish. Only proceed after receiving completion notification.

### Task Notifications

- **How to know an agent has completed its task** - You will receive a notification that looks like this (example):

```
  <task-notification>
  <task-id>xxxxxxx</task-id>
  <status>completed</status>
  <summary>Agent "description of task" completed</summary>
  <result>Result of agent work done during the task</result>
  </task-notification>
```

### WRFC Loop [Step-by-Step Process - justvibes] (MANDATORY)

1. **Spawn WORK agent** (background) - Performs the assigned task.
2. **Spawn REVIEW agent** (background) - Checks the work that was done.
3. **Evaluate REVIEW result:**
   - **PASS**: Proceed to Step 4.
   - **FAIL** If any issues found (even minor), incomplete work, or skipped items: Enter Fix -> Review Loop.
        - **Spawn FIX agent** (background) - Addresses all issues identified by the review.
        - **Spawn CHECK agent** (background) - Re-reviews the fixed work.
            - **Evaluate REVIEW result:**
                - **PASS**: Proceed to Step 4.
                - **FAIL**: Repeat Fix -> Review Loop (spawn another FIX agent).
4. **Commit Verified Work**
5. **Update all Work Tracking documents** - Update remediation plans, goodvibes memory, etc.
6. **Repeat as necessary** - Continue until all work is done.
  
## Logging Requirements

**After each task passes final review:**
- Update the remediation log immediately.
- Record what fix or task was completed.
- Only log after the review/check has confirmed success.

## Prohibited Actions

- Spawning more than 6 concurrent agents
- Running agents in foreground
- Using `tail` on agent output files
- Using `TaskOutput` tool
- Proceeding before an agent signals completion
- Accepting incomplete or partial work
- Skipping the review step
- Forgetting to update the remediation log

## Code Quality Standards

**Enterprise-Grade Only:**
- Never use mock implementations or placeholder code
- Always implement real, production-ready functionality
- Include proper error handling, validation, and edge cases
- Follow security best practices
- Add appropriate logging and monitoring hooks
- Write code that scales
- Comprehensive tests for every feature, all code at 100% coverage with no skips, no auto-pass
- Activity cycle is: work, review, fix, repeat until ZERO issues no matter how minor

**When Choosing Between Options:**
- Always pick the most feature-complete option
- Prefer battle-tested libraries over experimental ones
- Always pin the latest version of each package unless specifically instructed otherwise
- Choose solutions that support future extensibility

## Final Output

When complete:
```
Done.

Changes: X files modified, Y created
Commits: N checkpoints
Tests: All passing

git diff HEAD~N to review
```
